# Python-Project1
This is a Word Guessing Game written in python where the player tries to guess the letter of a hidden word.

Description of the program:
The program randomly selects a word for the player, to guess each letter in the word from a list of words.
The  player has n-1 turns to guess the letters of the word, where n is the length of the word.
The player can only guess one word at a time. 
If the letter is guessed correctly, it reveals the letter exact position.
Incorrect guesses reduce the number of turns
Also the player cannot repeat guesses
If the player guesses the full word before using all turns, they win
If the word is not guessed correctly after each turn, the player gets one turn to guess the full word.
if the final full word guess is also wrong the game ends.
